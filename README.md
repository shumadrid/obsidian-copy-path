# Copy Path

This is a simple plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that adds context menu actions for copying the full or vault relative paths of files and folders.

## Installation

[Download](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=copy-path) the plugin from the official Community Plugins repository.

## Settings

- **"Copy vault path" context menu action**: Show the option to copy the vault path of a file or folder.
- **"Copy full path" context menu action**: Show the option to copy the full path of a file or folder.
- **"Add trailing slash to folder paths"**: When enabled, folder paths will end with a trailing slash (e.g., `folder/`) to distinguish them from files. This applies to both vault and full path copying.

You can toggle these settings in the plugin's settings tab.
